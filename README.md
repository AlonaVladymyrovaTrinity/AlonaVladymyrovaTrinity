# Codewars
<p>
<a href="www.codewars.com/r/aDsx6g">Codewars</a> is an open source community of people with common interest and passion for coding.
It offers huge learning opportunities by solving programming challenges (refered to as katas)
and sparring with other programmers in code snippets (called kumite). 
Challenges are available in a large variety of languages and are validated using a custom <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a> framework.<br><br>

Rank
The rank level reflects your experience and knowledge you have gained by solving kata. You start at the lowest rank of 8 kyū, and each correct solution brings you closer to a higher rank. You can see your rank progress toward the next level on your profile page.
Ranks are used to indicate the proficiency of users and the difficulty of Kata. 
 
 <b>8 Kyu to 1 Kyu</b>
